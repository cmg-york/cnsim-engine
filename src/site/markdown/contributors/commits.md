# Commit Conventions and Principles

## Principles
- Each commit should strive to address one and only work item (Jira Issue).
	- Avoid commits that address more than one work items.
	- Avoid commits that relate to no explicit work item.
- Every commit should include trailing key : value pairs as per the description below.
## Format

```
<type>([optional scope]): <description>

[body]

% FOOTER %
[footers]
```

where 
- - `<type>` is one or more of the types below, e.g. `MILESTONE,fix`
- `[scope]` refers to the specific area that is affected e.g., `reporting`, `sampling` or `none`, `all`, and `other` -- the latter when scope is unclear
- `<description>` title of commit 50 chars or less in imperative "change", "fix", "update" etc.
- `[footers]` as follows:
	- `<type-of>`: `<type>`
	- `<action>`: \[Jira Issue URI\]
	- `<action>`-desc: \[copy/paste title/description of issue\]
	- `BREAKING CHANGE:` description
- `<action>` is one of:
	- `addresses` the commit represents progress towards the referred issue but not resolution
	- `closes` when the commit marks resolution of the referred issue
	- `relates-to` commit relates to referred issue
	- `introduces` commit serves as the introduction 

| Type       | Purpose                                                        |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `feat`     | Introduces a new feature                                       |
| `fix`      | Fixes a bug                                                    |
| `docs`     | Documentation-only changes                                     |
| `style`    | Formatting, spacing, semicolons (no logic changes)             |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring without behavior change                     |
| `perf`     | Performance improvement                                        |
| `test`     | Adds or corrects tests                                         |
| `chore`    | Miscellaneous maintenance (e.g., `.gitignore`)                 |
| `build`    | Build system or dependency changes (`pom.xml`, etc.)           |
| `ci`       | CI/CD configuration changes (e.g., GitHub Actions)             |
| `revert`   | Reverts a previous commit                                      |
| `version`  | Reflects a commit that marks a concrete version of the product |

### Examples

#### A documentation restructuring

```
docs(site): Restructure documentation

- Produced a new structure for the site.
- Site now under /src/site/.
- mvn clean site now copies generates /target/site and apidocs within it, then copies to /docs.

% FOOTER %
type-of: docs

closes: https://esg-yorku-team.atlassian.net/browse/CE-26
closes-desc: "Investigate and Document Documentation Update Workflow"

initiates: https://esg-yorku-team.atlassian.net/browse/CE-30
initiates-descr: Allow Latex-style formulae in docs. Currently all documentation is generated by `mvn clean site` Works well except that MD formulae such as $\sigma = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i{(x_i - \mu)}^2}$ that appear in MD do not render in the HTML.

## Structure

Based on [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/),
the standard commit structure is:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

For multi-line commit messages, it's highly recommended to open an editor  
(e.g., Vim, Nano, VS Code) via: `git commit`

To change default editor, run:

```bash
# Nano 
git config --global core.editor "nano"

# Vim
git config --global core.editor "vim"

# Visual Studio Code
git config --global core.editor "code --wait"
```

If you only want to commit the subject line (`<type>[optional scope]: <description>`),
then `git commit -m "..."` is fine.

The subject line should ideally be 50 characters or less.
Each line of the body and footer should wrap at 72 characters.

### Type

- What kind of change is it

| Type       | Purpose                                              |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `feat`     | Introduces a new feature                             |
| `fix`      | Fixes a bug                                          |
| `docs`     | Documentation-only changes                           |
| `style`    | Formatting, spacing, semicolons (no logic changes)   |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring without behavior change           |
| `perf`     | Performance improvement                              |
| `test`     | Adds or corrects tests                               |
| `chore`    | Miscellaneous maintenance (e.g., `.gitignore`)       |
| `build`    | Build system or dependency changes (`pom.xml`, etc.) |
| `ci`       | CI/CD configuration changes (e.g., GitHub Actions)   |
| `revert`   | Reverts a previous commit                            |

### Scope

- The location, component, or module affected by the commit
- Scope can be omitted if the change is global or too difficult to assign to a component
- Avoid issue identifiers as scopes

> Some tools support multiple or nested scopes:
> - Single: (ui)
> - Multiple: (auth,api)
> - Hierarchical: (ui/docs)
>
> The official spec only defines single scopes.

### Breaking change

- Marks a change that breaks backward compatibility
    - Someone upgrades to the new version without changing anything, and their code breaks
- Add `!` after the type/scope
    - `fix!: ...`
    - `feat(api)!: ...`

### Description

- Summary or high-level overview of what the commit accomplishes
- Imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"

### Body

- Provides context and rationale for the change
- Avoid explaining how it was implemented as diff already does
- Can have multiple paragraphs
- Bullet points are fine if they help clarity

### Footer(s)

- Additional info such as references, links, or metadata
- Follows a token format:
    - `<token>: <value>`
    - `<token> <value>`

Common tokens:

| Token                            | Description                                                           |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `BREAKING CHANGE: <description>` | Indicates an incompatible or backward-incompatible change             |
| `Fixes: <issue number>`          | Fixes a bug                                                           |
| `Closes: <issue number>`         | Closes an issue or PR                                                 |
| `Resolves: <issue number>`       | Alternative to `Closes:`                                              |
| `Related: <issue number>`        | References a related issue or pull request                            |
| `Refs: <issue number>`           | Points to related work or dependencies                                |
| `Co-authored-by: <name> <email>` | Indicates a co-author of the commit                                   |
| `Reviewed-by: <name> <email>`    | Indicates the reviewer of the commit                                  |
| `Signed-off-by: <name> <email>`  | Used for Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) compliance or sign-off |
| `See-also: <issue or PR>`        | Links to additional related issues, PRs, or external references       |

> A footerâ€™s token MUST use - in place of whitespace characters,
> e.g., Acked-by (this helps differentiate the footer section from a multi-paragraph body).
> An exception is made for BREAKING CHANGE, which MAY also be used as a token.

> If included in the type/scope prefix, breaking changes MUST be indicated by a `!` immediately before the `:`.
> If `!` is used, `BREAKING CHANGE:` MAY be omitted from the footer section, and the commit description
> SHALL be used to describe the breaking change.

### Examples

Subject line with type, scope, and description:

```
fix(parser): handle unexpected end-of-file error

BREAKING CHANGE: fields `first_name` and `last_name` replace `full_name`.
```

Multi-line commits:

```text
